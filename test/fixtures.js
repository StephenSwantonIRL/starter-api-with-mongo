  description: "<p>If you miss hearing Longplayer on your next trip to London, you’ll get the chance to catch it again—the musical composition will be playing in the old lighthouse at Trinity Buoy Wharf for the next 1,000 years. Longplayer consists of six short recorded pieces written for Tibetan singing bowls that are transposed and combined in such a way that the variations will never repeat during the song’s millennium-long run. It began playing on December 31, 1999, and is scheduled to end in the dying seconds of 2999.</p><p>Custodians of the project have established the Longplayer Trust to devise ways of keeping the music alive in the face of the inevitable technological and social changes that will occur over the next ten centuries.</p>",

Around 60,000 of the barking, flopping, waddling brown fur seals jostle for space on the half-mile-long, 164-foot-wide (50 m) Seal Island.</p><p>From a tour boat, the cacophonous jostling is a compelling sight, but it’s the overwhelming smell—a unique bouquet of rotting fish and excrement—that makes the boldest impression. This, however, is before you view the effects of the “ring of death,” a circle of great white sharks that surrounds the island waiting for seals to enter the water. When they do, the sharks pursue them relentlessly.</p><p>It’s not unusual to see a great white suddenly breach the surface and hurtle into the air with a seal struggling in its jaws. The sharks are fast, brutal, and capable of chomping seals to death in under a minute. It’s a violent sight, and you can’t help but root for the seal. Sometimes, after a thrilling battle, they get away.</p>",
